/**
 * Fan geometry and timing, measured off the reference recordings.
 *
 * Tracking the incoming card through a switch gives ~170px of travel and a
 * hard decelerate: a third of the distance in the first 33ms, 75% by 100ms,
 * and the last 8% spread over the remaining 160ms.
 *
 * Card width, slot spacing and tilt live in CSS variables (see the container's
 * classes) so the fan shrinks to fit a phone rather than being clipped. A
 * rotated card occupies roughly W·cosθ + H·sinθ of width, so the tilt has to
 * come down on narrow screens too, or its corners still push past the edge.
 *
 * LIFT is how far each step back sits below the front card. A tilted side card
 * raises its inner top corner by (W/2)·sinθ + (H/2)·cosθ; the drop only needs
 * to be enough that the corner tucks behind the front card rather than
 * breaking its top edge. Scaling the side cards down does most of that work,
 * so the drop stays small and the three read as one aligned group.
 */

// Degrees of in-plane rotation per step back. Measured off the reference two

// reference's ~2.5° deliberately, so the tilt reads clearly.

/**
 * Note: the two swapping cards briefly tilt the *same* direction mid-flight —
 * one runs −5°→0° while the other runs 0°→−5°, so both sit at negative angles
 * at once. That falls out of the slot interpolation and needs no extra motion;
 * applying a swing to the fan would drag the idle card along with it.

/**
 * Room left under the fan for the cards' drop shadow.
 *
 * The phone layout clips the container so the side cards can run off the
 * screen edges, and a bounding rect stops at the border box — it knows nothing
 * about the shadow. Hugging the lowest card therefore put the clip line
 * exactly where `0 18px 40px -24px` starts, slicing it into a hard edge.
 *
 * A blur of b reaches b/2 past the shadow's own edge, so the shadow ends
 * 18 + 20 − 24 = 14px below the card. Doubled here, because the side cards are
 * rotated and their shadow turns with them, dropping the low corner further.

 * translucent — so the card behind a side card read straight through it, and
 * the fan stopped looking like three solid objects. The cards now stay opaque
 * and a veil in the page colour is laid over their contents instead, giving
 * the same recession with nothing showing through. The values are what the old
 * opacities resolved to against the page: 1 − 0.55 and 1 − 0.75.
